      "description": "# Neo-Brutalist Design System Tour\n\nThis tour explores the neo-brutalist design system implemented across the BlvckSmith website. Neo-brutalism is characterized by bold typography, high contrast, sharp edges, and an unapologetic approach to design.\n\nIn this tour, we'll examine:\n\n1. The color palette and typography choices\n2. UI component design patterns\n3. Animation and interaction design\n4. Responsive design implementation\n5. Consistency across different site sections\n\nLet's begin by looking at the core design elements."

      "description": "# Color Palette\n\nThe site uses a limited but high-impact color palette that's characteristic of neo-brutalist design:\n\n- **Black (#000000)**: Used for strong borders, backgrounds, and primary text\n- **White/Off-white (#FAFAFA)**: Used for backgrounds and contrast text\n- **Yellow (#FACC15)**: Used as an accent color for highlights and important elements\n- **Gray (#E4E4E7)**: Used for cards and secondary backgrounds\n- **Red (#EF4444)**: Used sparingly for extra emphasis\n\nThese colors are configured in the Tailwind configuration file and used consistently throughout the site."

      "description": "# Typography and Global Styles\n\nThe typography follows neo-brutalist principles with:\n\n- **Bold, high-contrast text**: Especially for headings\n- **Clean sans-serif fonts**: For readability and modern feel\n- **'Orbitron' font**: Used for brand elements and section headings\n- **Font weight contrast**: Strong contrast between bold and regular text\n\nGlobal styles establish baseline rules that ensure design consistency across all pages."

      "title": "Card Components",
      "description": "# Card Components Design\n\nThe ProjectCard component exemplifies neo-brutalist card design with:\n\n1. **Bold black borders**: 2px+ thick borders that define card edges\n2. **Hard drop shadows**: 8px offset black shadows (no blur) that create a physical, layered effect\n3. **High contrast interior**: Typically light backgrounds with dark text\n4. **Geometric shapes**: Yellow accent elements that overlap borders\n5. **Minimal rounded corners**: Sharp edges rather than soft rounded corners\n\nThis card pattern is used consistently throughout the site for various content types."

      "description": "# Animation Design\n\nThe animations follow neo-brutalist principles with:\n\n1. **Simple movements**: Direct, purposeful animations without excessive bounce or spring\n2. **Deliberate timing**: Slightly slower animations that feel intentional rather than slick\n3. **Transform-based effects**: Using scale, rotation, and translation for visual impact\n4. **Sequential timing**: Elements that animate in sequence rather than all at once\n\nThese animations add visual interest without contradicting the bold, direct nature of the design."
