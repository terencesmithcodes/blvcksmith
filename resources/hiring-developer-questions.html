            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Choosing the right web developer or development agency is one of the most important decisions you'll make for your digital project. The right partner will not only build your vision but enhance it with their expertise. The wrong partner can lead to wasted time, budget overruns, and a subpar result.</p>
            <p>Before you sign a contract, ask these five critical questions to ensure you're making the right choice.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <div class="question">
                <h3>Question 1: Can I see examples of similar projects you've completed?</h3>
                <p>Ask to see projects similar to yours in terms of scope, functionality, or industry. This gives you insight into their experience with problems like yours.</p>
                
                <div class="good-answer">
                    <h4>What a Good Answer Sounds Like:</h4>
                    <p>"Here are three e-commerce sites we've built for companies in your industry. For each, I can walk you through the specific challenges we faced and how we solved them. I can also introduce you to these clients if you'd like references."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="poor-answer">
                    <h4>What Should Raise Concerns:</h4>
                    <p>"We have a portfolio on our website" (without specific examples relevant to your project), or vague responses that don't include concrete examples.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="question">
                <h3>Question 2: What is your development process, and how will we collaborate?</h3>
                <p>Understanding how the developer works and communicates is crucial for a smooth project. Their process should be clear and include regular check-ins.</p>
                
                <div class="good-answer">
                    <h4>What a Good Answer Sounds Like:</h4>
                    <p>"We follow an agile approach with two-week sprints. You'll receive a demo of progress every two weeks and have the opportunity to provide feedback. We use Slack for day-to-day communication and have a project management system where you can track progress and submit feedback. We typically expect client input at these specific milestones..."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="poor-answer">
                    <h4>What Should Raise Concerns:</h4>
                    <p>"We'll build it and show you when it's done," or any answer that suggests minimal client involvement until completion.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="question">
                <h3>Question 3: How do you handle changes to requirements during the project?</h3>
                <p>Projects evolve, and you need to understand how the developer manages scope changes and their impact on timeline and budget.</p>
                
                <div class="good-answer">
                    <h4>What a Good Answer Sounds Like:</h4>
                    <p>"When you request a change, we'll evaluate its impact on the project scope, timeline, and budget. We'll provide you with an estimate for implementing the change, and you can decide whether to proceed. Small changes that don't affect the scope significantly are typically included at no additional cost. Here's our formal change request process..."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="poor-answer">
                    <h4>What Should Raise Concerns:</h4>
                    <p>"We charge for any changes," or "We can make unlimited changes," both of which are unrealistic extremes.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="question">
                <h3>Question 4: What happens after the site launches?</h3>
                <p>A website is never truly "finished." You need to understand the ongoing support available to you after launch.</p>
                
                <div class="good-answer">
                    <h4>What a Good Answer Sounds Like:</h4>
                    <p>"After launch, we provide a 30-day warranty period for fixing any bugs at no additional cost. We offer several maintenance packages for ongoing support, including security updates, content changes, and performance monitoring. If you prefer to maintain the site yourself, we provide documentation and training for your team."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="poor-answer">
                    <h4>What Should Raise Concerns:</h4>
                    <p>"Our work is done when the site launches," or vague assurances without specific support options.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="question">
                <h3>Question 5: What do you need from me to make this project successful?</h3>
                <p>This question reveals how the developer views the client-developer relationship and clarifies your responsibilities.</p>
                
                <div class="good-answer">
                    <h4>What a Good Answer Sounds Like:</h4>
                    <p>"We'll need you to provide timely feedback on deliverables, content for the site (or approval of content we create), prompt responses to questions, and participation in weekly check-in calls. The most successful projects have active client engagement throughout the process."</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="poor-answer">
                    <h4>What Should Raise Concerns:</h4>
                    <p>"Just the deposit," or any answer that doesn't acknowledge the collaborative nature of successful web projects.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Bonus Question: How do you approach website security and performance?</h2>
            <p>This additional question helps you understand if the developer prioritizes these critical aspects of website development.</p>
            
            <div class="good-answer">
                <h4>What a Good Answer Sounds Like:</h4>
                <p>"We implement several security practices including regular updates, secure authentication methods, data encryption, and input validation. For performance, we optimize images, implement caching, use content delivery networks, and follow best practices for code efficiency. We also conduct regular security audits and performance testing."</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="poor-answer">
                <h4>What Should Raise Concerns:</h4>
                <p>"We use a security plugin," or any answer that suggests security and performance are afterthoughts rather than built-in features of the development process.</p>
