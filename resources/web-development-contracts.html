            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>A well-crafted web development contract protects both you and your developer while setting clear expectations for your project. This guide will help you understand the key elements that should be included in your web development contract and what to look for before signing.</p>
            
            <div class="callout">
                <h4>Why Contracts Matter</h4>
                <p>Even if you trust your developer completely, a detailed contract helps prevent misunderstandings and provides a clear reference point if questions arise during the project.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Essential Contract Elements</h2>
            
            <h3>1. Detailed Project Scope</h3>
            <p>The contract should clearly define what is being built, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Specific pages and features to be created</li>
                <li>Functionality that will be included</li>
                <li>Deliverables (e.g., design files, source code, documentation)</li>
                <li>What is explicitly NOT included in the project</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Vague descriptions like "a modern e-commerce website" are not sufficient. The more detailed the scope, the less room there is for misinterpretation.</p>

            <h3>2. Timeline and Milestones</h3>
            <p>Look for clear timeframes, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Project start and end dates</li>
                <li>Key milestone deadlines</li>
                <li>Review periods for your feedback</li>
                <li>Contingency plans for delays</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Payment Terms</h3>
            <p>The contract should outline:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Total project cost</li>
                <li>Payment schedule (tied to milestones, not dates)</li>
                <li>Accepted payment methods</li>
                <li>Handling of additional costs or change requests</li>
                <li>Late payment penalties, if applicable</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Be wary of contracts requiring large upfront payments without clear deliverables.</p>

            <h3>4. Change Request Process</h3>
            <p>The contract should explain how changes to the original scope will be handled, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Process for requesting changes</li>
                <li>How changes will be estimated and approved</li>
                <li>Impact on timeline and budget</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5. Ownership and Intellectual Property</h3>
            <p>Clarify who owns what when the project is complete:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ownership of the final website</li>
                <li>Ownership of the source code</li>
                <li>Rights to design elements and content</li>
                <li>Usage rights for third-party assets</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Generally, you should own the final product after payment, but some developers may retain rights to certain components or require attribution.</p>

            <h3>6. Testing and Acceptance</h3>
            <p>Look for clear criteria regarding:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>How the project will be tested</li>
                <li>Definition of "completion"</li>
                <li>Acceptance process for deliverables</li>
                <li>Handling of revisions and bug fixes</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>7. Maintenance and Support</h3>
            <p>Understand what happens after launch:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Warranty period for fixing bugs or issues</li>
                <li>Availability and cost of post-launch support</li>
                <li>Terms for ongoing maintenance (if included)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>8. Termination Clauses</h3>
            <p>The contract should address:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Conditions under which either party can end the agreement</li>
                <li>Notice periods required</li>
                <li>Payment for work completed prior to termination</li>
                <li>Ownership of materials if the project ends early</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Red Flags to Watch For</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Vague Deliverables:</strong> If the contract doesn't clearly state what you'll receive, push for more details.</li>
                <li><strong>No Change Request Process:</strong> Projects evolve, and you need a clear process for handling changes.</li>
                <li><strong>Unclear Copyright Terms:</strong> Make sure you'll own what you pay for, or at least understand any limitations.</li>
                <li><strong>Missing Deadlines:</strong> Without specific timeframes, projects can drag on indefinitely.</li>
                <li><strong>Large Upfront Payments:</strong> Milestone-based payments protect both parties.</li>
                <li><strong>No Testing Procedures:</strong> There should be a clear process for determining when work is complete and acceptable.</li>
            </ul>
