            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Website security is no longer optional for businesses of any size. With cyber attacks increasing in frequency and sophistication, protecting your website and your customers' data is both a technical necessity and a business responsibility.</p>
            <p>This guide provides business owners with essential information about web security risks and practical steps to mitigate them—without requiring deep technical knowledge.</p>
            
            <div class="callout">
                <h4>Why Security Matters</h4>
                <p>The average cost of a data breach for small businesses is approximately $108,000. Beyond the financial impact, security breaches can damage customer trust, affect your reputation, and result in legal liabilities. Investing in security now can prevent significant problems later.</p>

            <h2>Essential Security Measures</h2>
            
            <h3>1. HTTPS and SSL/TLS Encryption</h3>
            <p>HTTPS encrypts data transmitted between your website and visitors, protecting sensitive information and building trust.</p>
            <div class="callout">
                <h4>Business Impact</h4>
                <p>Beyond security, HTTPS is now a ranking factor for search engines and is visually indicated in browsers. Websites without HTTPS may display warning messages to visitors, potentially driving them away.</p>
            </div>
            <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Purchase an SSL certificate from your hosting provider or use a free service like Let's Encrypt. Most modern hosting platforms offer one-click SSL installation.</p>
            
            <h3>2. Regular Updates and Patching</h3>
            <p>Keeping your website's software, plugins, and components updated is one of the simplest yet most effective security measures.</p>
            <div class="callout">
                <h4>Business Impact</h4>
                <p>Outdated software is one of the most common entry points for attackers. Regular updates not only improve security but often enhance performance and add new features.</p>
            </div>
            <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Set up automatic updates where possible, or establish a regular schedule for manual updates. Always backup before updating critical components.</p>
            
            <h3>3. Secure Authentication Practices</h3>
            <p>Strong authentication protects access to your website's admin areas and user accounts.</p>
            <div class="security-solution">
                <h4>Key Authentication Practices:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Require strong, unique passwords (12+ characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols)</li>
                    <li>Implement two-factor authentication (2FA)</li>
                    <li>Use password managers for generating and storing complex passwords</li>
                    <li>Limit failed login attempts</li>
                    <li>Implement session timeouts for inactive users</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h3>4. Regular Backups</h3>
            <p>Even with strong security measures, having recent backups is your safety net against data loss.</p>
            <div class="callout">
                <h4>Business Impact</h4>
                <p>In case of a security breach, having clean backups can significantly reduce downtime and recovery costs. Backups are also valuable protection against accidental data loss or corruption.</p>
            </div>
            <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Automate daily backups of your website files and database. Store backups securely in multiple locations, including off-site. Regularly test the restoration process.</p>
            
            <h3>5. Web Application Firewall (WAF)</h3>
            <p>A WAF filters traffic to your website, blocking malicious requests before they reach your site.</p>
            <div class="callout">
                <h4>Business Impact</h4>
                <p>A WAF can protect against many common attack vectors automatically, reducing the technical burden on your team and providing 24/7 protection.</p>
            </div>
            <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> WAF solutions are available through many hosting providers, CDN services like Cloudflare, or as dedicated services.</p>

            <h2>Data Protection and Privacy</h2>
            
            <h3>Customer Data Security</h3>
            <p>Protecting customer data is both an ethical responsibility and often a legal requirement.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Only collect necessary data:</strong> Minimize risk by only collecting information you actually need</li>
                <li><strong>Encrypt sensitive data:</strong> Personal information and payment details should always be encrypted</li>
                <li><strong>Implement proper access controls:</strong> Limit who in your organization can access customer data</li>
                <li><strong>Have a data breach response plan:</strong> Know what steps to take if customer data is compromised</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Privacy Regulations</h3>
            <p>Depending on your location and customer base, your website may need to comply with various privacy regulations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>GDPR (European Union):</strong> Comprehensive data protection law affecting businesses worldwide that serve EU customers</li>
                <li><strong>CCPA/CPRA (California):</strong> Privacy regulations for businesses serving California residents</li>
                <li><strong>PIPEDA (Canada):</strong> Canadian privacy law for commercial activities</li>
                <li><strong>Industry-specific regulations:</strong> Such as HIPAA for healthcare or PCI DSS for credit card processing</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="callout">
                <h4>Compliance Basics</h4>
                <p>Most privacy regulations require:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Clear privacy policies explaining data collection and usage</li>
                    <li>Mechanisms for users to access, correct, or delete their data</li>
                    <li>Consent mechanisms for cookies and tracking</li>
                    <li>Reasonable security measures to protect collected data</li>
